# Implementation Planning

## User Story/Requirements:

{detailed description of what needs to be implemented}

## AI Task: Generate a Comprehensive Implementation Plan

Based on the above requirements, create a detailed implementation plan that a developer can follow. Focus on architecture and approach rather than complete code. The plan should be thorough but concise.

1. **Requirement Analysis:**

   - Restate the core requirements and objectives in technical terms
   - Identify key constraints, edge cases, and potential challenges
   - Clarify any ambiguous aspects that would need developer decisions

2. **Architecture & Design:**

   - Outline the high-level architecture for the implementation
   - Identify components, services, or modules that will be affected
   - Describe any design patterns or principles that should be applied
   - Suggest data structures, state management approaches, and interfaces

3. **Implementation Steps:**

   - Break down the implementation into logical, sequential steps
   - For each step:
     - Describe what needs to be done (not detailed code)
     - Identify target files/components to modify or create
     - Explain the purpose and expected behavior of the changes
   - Highlight dependencies between steps if applicable

4. **Technical Considerations:**

   - Performance implications and optimization opportunities
   - Security considerations (if applicable)
   - Testing approach and test cases to consider
   - Backwards compatibility concerns
   - Error handling strategy

5. **Alternatives Considered:**

   - Briefly describe alternative approaches that were considered
   - Explain the trade-offs and why the proposed approach is recommended

6. **Resources & References:**
   - Suggest relevant documentation, examples, or resources that might help
   - Reference similar patterns in the existing codebase if applicable

The goal is to provide a clear roadmap for implementation that addresses the requirements comprehensively while leaving the actual coding to the developer. The plan should be detailed enough to guide implementation decisions but not prescribe every line of code.
